# [Project 1: Deep Reinforcement Learning Tetris AI](https://github.com/andreanlay/tetris-ai-deep-reinforcement-learning)
* An AI learned to play Tetris using Value Function based Deep Reinforcement Learning
* Hand-engineered features are used to predict the quality of each possible state
* AI try to check each possible state and choose the best state that yield maximum future reward which make it possible to clear multiple lines
* 2 x 64 neurons hidden layer were used as the Deep Q Network

# [Project 2: Handwritten Character Recognition Using CNN](https://github.com/andreanlay/handwritten-character-recognition-deep-learning)
* NIST and MNIST dataset were used to train the network
* Using data augmentation to produce more relevant data for the network to learn
* Modified LeNet5's architecture and learnable pooling layers were used
